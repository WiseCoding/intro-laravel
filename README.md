# Assignment 📝

> A local restaurant has seen a decline in the number of clients in the past year. They decided to hire a new chef, renovate the furniture and develop a new menu.
> They could wait a few months to see if the changes work, but they would like some feedback earlier. They ask you to build them a simple website to collect reviews from the new clients.
> They believe in radical transparency, so they want all the reviews to be publicly accessible.

## _Must-have features_

-   The website will have 2 pages: Home, and Reviews
-   The home page will show a few pictures of the restaurant (tip: get some from Unsplash), and a menu (tip: it's a minimalist menu with only 3 choices of meal, no drinks, and no desserts 🤷‍♂️)
-   The Reviews page will have a form to collect reviews with: name of the reviewer (required), 1-5 star choice (required), comment (optional)
-   Under the form, the Reviews page will show the last 10 reviews submitted
-   The header of both pages will contain the restaurant's logo and the links to the two pages (Home and Reviews)
-   The footer of both pages will contain the restaurant's address and opening hours
